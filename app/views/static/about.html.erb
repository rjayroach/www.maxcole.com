Ruby conference: 
I am a CTO for a startup.  Company is in a loyalty programme business.  We use Ruby on Rails and Foundation front end framework.  The way it works is business signs up merchants and the merchants don't need any software installed they access applications through browser. First time they sign up they get posters on the table saying member of fan club get 15% dissent.  How it works isâ€¦

It is building a customer CRM based on loyalty programme.
